# Chest-Image-classification

We design a lightweight CNN architecture for the chest x-ray classi-32
fication task by introducing ExLNet which uses a novel DCISE blocks to reduce the33
computational burden. We show the effectiveness of the proposed architecture through34
various experiments performed on publicly available datasets. The proposed architec-35
ture shows consistent performance in binary as well as multi-class classification tasks36
and outperforms other lightweight CNN architectures. Due to a significant reduction37
in the computational requirements, our method can be useful for resource-constrained clinical environments.
