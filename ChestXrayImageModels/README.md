# **How to use**

1) allModels file cotains all the models for the image classification of chest-xray nih dataset
2) saved_models conatains all the models that have performed good in the classification task
4) there is also a tutorial file named *evaluating_saved_models.ipynb* reference can be taken from that 

# **How to use the jupyter notebook files**

1) There is one file in allModels folder i.e pyt_model_class.py this we have created to do make the working with pytorch handy so just import this and use in you system
2) Be careful to change the respective paths of the files and folders according to your need | no need to change anything in the .py files 
3) the saved models are given here one can also just import these models using pytroch [load_model](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html) command 

# **Models used and versions**

1) python version : 3.7
2) pytorch version : 1.19 + cuda10.2
3) squeezenet version : squeezenet_1_0 / squeezenet_1_1
4) mobilenet version : mobilenet_v2 / mobilenet_v3
5) shufflenet version : shufflenet_v2_x1_0

**one can also find these versions in the respective files also**
